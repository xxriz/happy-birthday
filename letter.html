        <p>Dear Ain,</p>
        <p>
            At the time of writing this, I am unsure if this will reach you or not. But if you do, I would like to apologize upfront 
            if this letter might have disturbed your peace or caused any confusion towards your feelings. I harbor no ill intentions and the following wall 
            of text is a culmination of a deep reflection and appreciation of our time together. Additionally, there are some things I have to own up to 
            you as a person.
        </p>
    
        <p>
            If this letter does find you, there are some things that I want you to know.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            You meant the world to me and still do. I miss hearing about your day and the little things we used to share. But I respect your boundaries, and I'm afraid to ask sometimes. I miss waking
            up to your good morning texts and saying goodnight to each other every day. I miss preparing food for you whenever I got the chance, I miss watching shows and playing games together, and going out
            together to places I thought I would never set foot in. I miss browsing things on the internet late at night on Discord with you. I miss sharing funny and stupid posts/texts on every social media platform. I don't regret one
            second I spent with you, not even our silly arguements.
        </p>

        <p>    
            You were my first and only love. I proudly say this with every fibre of my being. To be honest, I had no idea what love was like before I met you. I spent so many years of my life
            waiting to give my heart and soul to someone, only to be disappointed time and time again. You were the one and only person in 23 years of my life that opened me up to the
            possibilities of love. For that, I wanted to give my heartful thank you. Thank you for making me feel loved and allowing me to love.
        </p>

        <p>
            You were there for me during my ups and downs. I will never forget that, ever. Even though we are very different, it felt like we had so much in common. I know you said you feel better off 
            alone right now, and I respect that. But I've always wished that there was something I could've done differently so that things does not have to end this way.
        </p>

        <p>
            I was wrong for a multitude of things. I was wrong for the times I made you feel like something was your fault, when it was my own. I was wrong when I was unaware and not more proactive
            about acknowledging my mistakes. I was wrong for letting both of our life's problems creep into our relationship. I was wrong for not conducting myself better around everyone. I was wrong for not spending enough time with you when you were trying to
            have a conversation. I was wrong for talking to you in a harsh manner and used vulgar words to let my anger out. I was wrong for not being there for you. I was wrong.
        </p>

        <p>
            I remember at one point when we were together, we had a talk about not saying "sorry" because we tend to say it too much. But now I wish I could rewind back time and say sorry a million times for 
            all of the mistakes I have done. 
        </p>

        <p>
            While I am sorry for the times I have missed the mark and caused you pain, I have to thank you as well. Thank you for your time. Thank you for your affection. Thank you for 
            being the best person to be around. Thank you for always supporting me no matter what I do. Thank you for helping me discover the things I need to work on as a person. Thank you for keeping me in your 
            prayers. Thank you for making me stronger spiritually. Thank you for always reminding me to believe in my faith. Thank you, for telling the truth. Thank you for the laughs, the smiles, the big things, the small things,
            and everything in between.
        </p>


        <p>
            I will forever keep my door open because I wanted to tell myself that there is a timeline where we would cross paths again. I love you, and I would give up anything for you, regardless of anything that had happened.
            If I were to be asked by fate on whether or not I would want to go through all of this again, I would choose to do it in a heartbeat but this time, I will get things right.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The house that we both built, will forever welcome you.
        </p>

        <p>
            But, If our story were to truly end here, I will be happy and proud knowing I gave my all to fight for the person I love, and there is no shame in admitting that. I will always love you. Forever. And After.
        </p>

        <p>
            Sincerely,<br>
            Rizq

            P/S: I wish I could've re-made this song below in the piano for you but I lack the talent to finish the practice in time so I had to settle with the original instead. My apologies!
